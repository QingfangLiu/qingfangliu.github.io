	<h1>I'm Qingfang Liu!</h1>
	<p>I study cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience with computational models. I built this website to keep notes of my research work and blog my research activities. <a href="/about">Read more about me...</a>
	</p>
	
	<p>I'm a Ph.D. student in Department of Psychology of the Ohio State University, working with <a href="https://psychology.osu.edu/people/turner.826">Dr. Brandon M. Turner</a>. I'm interested in exploring different cognitive models mostly about decision-making and memory. I've been learning and using Bayesian methods for constructing and validating models. 
	</p>

	<p>In my first year of graduate study, I worked closely with my advisor and helped develop a  mechanistic model on a particular value-based decision making task - intertemporal choice. In my second year of graduate study, I studied the complex (still for me!) dynamical causal modeling and adapted it to accomodate choice and response time data to account for decision making tasks.
	</p>

	<p>Besides of the research work in the Department of psychology, I'm also working for a second degree of the applied statistic master and I'm most interested in the stochastic statistics.
