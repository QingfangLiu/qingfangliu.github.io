	<h1>Welcome to Qingfang Liu's research website! </h1>
	
	<p>I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Department of Psychology of the Ohio State University, working with Dr. Brandon M. Turner. I study cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience with computational models. I built this website to keep notes of my research work and blog my research activities. I'm interested in exploring different cognitive models mostly about decision-making and learning. I extensively rely on Bayesian methods for constructing and validating models. I'm also keen in model-based fMRI methods and excited in adopting those methods to advance our understanding of high-level cognitive tasks.
