	<h1>Hi, I'm Qingfang Liu ðŸ‘‹</h1>
	
<p>
    Iâ€™m a research scientist at the
<a href="https://irp.nida.nih.gov/organization/cnsb/learning-and-decision-making-unit/" target="_blank">Learning and Decision-Making Unit</a>
at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). I earned my Ph.D. in Psychology from The Ohio State University, where I specialized in cognitive and computational neuroscience under the mentorship of Dr. Brandon M. Turner in the
<a href="https://turner-mbcn.com/" target="_blank">Model-based Cognitive Neuroscience Lab</a>.
My work bridges cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and computational modeling to better understand the mechanisms underlying human decision-making and learning.
  </p>

  <p>
    I build and test cognitive modelsâ€”especially for decision-making (e.g., diffusion models) and learning 
    (e.g., category learning and reinforcement learning). I use Bayesian methods for model construction and 
    validation, and Iâ€™m passionate about model-based fMRI to study high-level cognition. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Though trained as a modeler, Iâ€™m also fascinated by experimental design in both human and animal studies. 
    This site serves as a hub for my research updates, notes, and blog posts.

  <p><strong>Letâ€™s connect!</strong> I'm always open to collaboration and discussion.</p>
