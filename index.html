	<h1>Qingfang Liu's research website! </h1>
	<p>I study cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience with computational models. I built this website to keep notes of my research work and blog my research activities. 
	</p>
	
	<p>I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Department of Psychology of the Ohio State University, working with Dr. Brandon M. Turner. I'm interested in exploring different cognitive models mostly about decision-making and learning. I've been learning and using Bayesian methods for constructing and validating models. 
	</p>

	<p>Besides of the research work in the Department of psychology, I'm also working for a second degree of the applied statistic master and I'm most interested in the stochastic statistics.
