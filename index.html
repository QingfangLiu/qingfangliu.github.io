	<h1>Hi, I'm Qingfang ðŸ‘‹</h1>
	
<p>
    Iâ€™m a research fellow at the
<a href="https://irp.nida.nih.gov/organization/cnsb/learning-and-decision-making-unit/" target="_blank">Learning and Decision-Making Unit</a>
at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). I earned my Ph.D. in Psychology from The Ohio State University, where I specialized in cognitive and computational neuroscience in the
<a href="https://turner-mbcn.com/" target="_blank">Model-based Cognitive Neuroscience Lab</a>.
  </p>


  <p>
My work bridges cognitive science, neuroscience, and computational modeling to better understand human decision-making and learning. Through years of research, hands-on experimentation, and data analysis, Iâ€™ve developed a versatile set of technical and analytical skills:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Programming & Tools:</strong> Python, R, MATLAB, Git, Bash, PySpark</li>
  <li><strong>Machine Learning & Statistics:</strong> Scikit-learn, Bayesian inference, generalized linear models (GLMs), mixed-effects models</li>
  <li><strong>Data Science:</strong> Data wrangling, visualization (Matplotlib, ggplot2), experimental design, hypothesis testing</li>
  <li><strong>Cognitive Modeling:</strong> Drift diffusion models (DDM), reinforcement learning models, model-based analysis of behavior and brain data</li>
  <li><strong>Neuroimaging & Neuromodulation:</strong> fMRI data analysis, model-based fMRI, SPM, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)</li>
  <li><strong>Soft Skills:</strong> Strategic thinking, scientific writing, mentoring, cross-disciplinary collaboration</li>
</ul>


<p> 
My research closely aligns with the goals of advanced AI by addressing fundamental questions about human cognition that are also relevant to the development of intelligent systems. First, I investigate the diverse cognitive mechanisms of inference supported by the brainâ€”particularly those that enable humans to make one-shot or few-shot decisions without altering long-term knowledge structures. This is conceptually analogous to how large language models perform inference without fine-tuning their foundational knowledge. Second, I explore the intersection of embodied cognition and adaptive behavior, examining how biological states, such as satiation, dynamically shape decision-making. These insights contribute to our understanding of how flexible, context-sensitive behavior emerges from biological systemsâ€”offering valuable guidance for building more adaptive and human-aligned AI.You can find my past and ongoing research projects on the <a href="/Research">Research</a> page.
