	<h1>Welcome to Qingfang Liu's research website! </h1>
	
	<p>I'm a PhD candidate in Department of Psychology of the Ohio State University, working with Dr. Brandon M. Turner. I study cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience with computational models. I built this website to keep notes of my research work and blog my research activities. I'm interested in exploring different cognitive models, mostly about decision-making (such as diffusion models and accumulation models) and learning (such as category learning models and reinforcement learning models). I extensively rely on Bayesian methods for constructing and validating models. I'm also keen in model-based fMRI methods and excited in adopting those methods to advance our understanding of high-level cognitive tasks. Although I was trained to be a modeler during my PhD, I'm also fascinated with cool experimental ideas either in human or in animals.
