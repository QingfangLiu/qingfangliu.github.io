	<p> 1. An integrative framework for explaining behavioral and fMRI data together.
	</p>
		
	<p>
	How do you deal with your behavioral data when you conduct neuroimaging studies? How can you identify any neural correlates of your computational mechanisms? Such questions motivated the field of model-based computational neuroscience, and my major work in my graduate school was to develop an integrative approach to explain behavioral and fMRI data together.

	<p> 2. A generative framework for modeling behavioral and eye fixation data together
	</p>	
	<p> Eye-tracking provides a proxy of attention mechanism during human decision making. Can we use current computational models to explain both attention and behavioral data? What does attention tell us beyond what was revealed by behavioral data? My dissertation work was focused on constructing such a framework so that we can leverage both the computational models and eye-tracking data to disclose decision mechanisms.
