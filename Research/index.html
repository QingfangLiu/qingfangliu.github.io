<h3>How the Brain Helps Us Adapt: Investigating the Orbitofrontal Cortex with TMS</h3>
<p>
Why can a chef anticipate and avoid a guest’s allergic reaction before it happens? This kind of flexible, outcome-guided behavior depends on our brain’s ability to simulate future consequences and update decisions when circumstances change.
</p>
<p>
In this project, I use non-invasive brain stimulation (TMS) to study how different parts of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) support this flexibility. By selectively disrupting anterior vs. posterior OFC networks during different stages of learning and decision-making, we found distinct roles: one region helps form associations, while another helps adapt to changes.
</p>
<p>
This research uncovers how the brain builds and updates its internal "map" of the world to guide adaptive, goal-directed behavior.

	<h3> An integrative framework for explaining behavioral and fMRI data together </h3>

		
	<p>
	How do you deal with your behavioral data when you conduct neuroimaging studies? How can you identify any neural correlates of your computational mechanisms? Such questions motivated the field of model-based computational neuroscience, and my major work in my graduate school was to develop an integrative approach to explain behavioral and fMRI data together.
