	<p> An integrative framework for explaining behavioral and fMRI data together. 
	How do you deal with your behavioral data when you conduct neuroimaging studies? How can you identify any neural correlates of your computational mechanisms? Such questions motivated the field of model-based computational neuroscience, and my major work in my graduate school was to develop an integrative approach to explain behavioral and fMRI data together.
