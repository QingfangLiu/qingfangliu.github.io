<h3>How the Brain Helps Us Adapt: Investigating the Orbitofrontal Cortex with TMS</h3>
<p>
Why can a chef anticipate and avoid a guest’s allergic reaction before it happens? This kind of flexible, outcome-guided behavior depends on our brain’s ability to simulate future consequences and update decisions when circumstances change. In this project, I use non-invasive brain stimulation (TMS) to study how different parts of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) support this flexibility. This research uncovers how the brain builds and updates its internal "map" of the world to guide adaptive, goal-directed behavior.

  Linking Brain and Behavior with Computational Models

<p>
How can we connect complex patterns of brain activity with the computations that drive decision-making? In this project, I developed an integrative model-based approach to jointly explain behavioral choices and fMRI data in two-alternative decision-making tasks (perceptual or social). This framework identifies neural correlates of latent cognitive processes, such as evidence accumulation, by aligning them with computational model predictions. I conducted extensive model simulations and parameter recovery analyses to validate the framework’s interpretability and robustness.
