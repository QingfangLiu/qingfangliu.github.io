			<h1>About</h1>
			<p> An integrative framework for explaining behavioral and fMRI data together. 
			</p>

			<p>
			In my first year of graduate study, I worked closely with my advisor and helped develop a  mechanistic model on a particular value-based decision making task - intertemporal choice. In my second year of graduate study, I studied the complex (still for me!) dynamical causal modeling and adapted it to accomodate choice and response time data to account for decision making tasks.

			Besides of the research work in the Department of psychology, I'm also working for a second degree of the applied statistic master and I'm most interested in the stochastic statistics.
