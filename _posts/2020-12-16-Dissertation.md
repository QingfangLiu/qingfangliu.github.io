Last night I sent my dissertation draft to my committee members for approval, so although technically I still need to work for my defense after three weeks, I don't really have much to do about my dissertation.

I want to reflect about the dissertation project since my mind is still wrapped by those ideas and/or regrets. My dissertation project is certainly a model-heavy project,  utilizing what I have learned about how to construct and evaluate cognitive models to understand human cognition. 

Two things jumped to my mind when I want to write this reflection. The first thing is always to start with simpler models when you want to build some novel and fancier models. It is extremely important to me because what I did in my early PhD was the opposite, that is, trying to include as many complex cognitive components into your model as you can. But I gradually realize building complex models without investigating simpler models first is very very risky. Classic models come with some reason - although simplistic, they tell something useful about underlying cognitive process and account for similar data well in the past. 

Evaluating classic models helps learn about the data characteristics. When fitting classic models, your mind is focused on the data, not on the model, because you are already familiar with the models, and you naturally pay more attention to your data. When I tried on the intertemporal choice modeling, although I didn't start with the classic hyperbolic model, I went back to fit it and surprisingly found its terrific fit to the behavioral choice data. Hence, I had to think carefully how I can add eye-tracking data to this modeling framework, given the fit by behavioral data only, instead of modeling everything together and showing off what I can get by throwing in everything.

The second thing occurred to me near the end of my thesis writing. That is, simulation is very important! Also, simulating with a variety of parameter values is important. In the pipeline of modeling work that I experienced, simulation is followed by model recovery to establish identifiability of model structure. Oftentimes I only simulated the model once or twice, and then I rushed to the recovery step. However, simulating the models can actually give useful insights about recovery, because we would expect the change of parameter values to influence the model output, if that parameter is identifiable. Loosely speaking, if the change of parameter values cannot really affect your model output, how can you imagine to identify it from your data?

Simulating the models provides the initial evidence to the role of parameters, the relationship of parameters, and probably the best source of information about how to modify the models in the next step. When you simulate your model, you are actually developing a new tool and holding on to it in your hands. But if you rush to the recovery or the estimation part, you send it to the factory and it's not so close to you anymore. So next time, before doing the time-consuming parameter recovery, start with as many simulations as you can think about!
