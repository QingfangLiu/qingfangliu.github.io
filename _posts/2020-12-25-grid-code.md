Summary: This study explored the organization of two-dimensional conceptual knowledge with fMRI, and identified the hexagonally summetric code, similar to what was found in spatial representation. The importance of this study is to fill the gap between spatial and non-spatial representation, with human fMRI results. 

What's good in this study
- idea of extending spatial navigation tasks to non-spatial tasks
- behavioral training tasks


What still confused me:
- Why did they use the 6 outcomes, instead of 4, 5, 8, or other numbers?
- Can we identify any behavioral evidence of such a hexagonally summetric code?
- Why did they include the "Imagination" stage in the fMRI task? To make it analogous to spatial navigation?
- Is the task still similar to a spatial task by adjusting ratio of neck/leg lengths? To what extent can we generalize this grid-like code to a simple association task? To what extent is the code related to conceptual knowledge?
