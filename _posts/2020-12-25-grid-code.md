Summary: This study explored the organization of two-dimensional conceptual knowledge with fMRI, and identified the hexagonally summetric code, similar to what was found in spatial representation. The importance of this study is to fill the gap between spatial and non-spatial representation, with human fMRI results. 

What still confused me:
- Why did they use the 6 outcomes, instead of 4, 5, 8, or other numbers?
- Can we identify any behavioral evidence of such a hexagonally summetric code?
