Summary: This study explored the organization of two-dimensional conceptual knowledge with fMRI, and identified the hexagonally summetric code, similar to what was found in spatial representation. The importance of this study is to fill the gap between spatial and non-spatial representation, with human fMRI results. 

What's good in this study
- idea of extending spatial navigation tasks to non-spatial tasks
- anology of non-spatial trajectory in abstract space to spatial movement direction
- considerations in behavioral training tasks
- control analyses of 4, 5, 6, 8 symmetries
- fMRI GLM analyses of sin and cos trick

What still confused me:
- Why did they use the 6 outcomes, instead of 4, 5, 8, or other numbers?
- Can we identify any behavioral evidence of such a hexagonally summetric code?
- Why did they include the "Imagination" stage in the fMRI task? To make it analogous to spatial navigation?
- Is the task still similar to a spatial task by adjusting ratio of neck/leg lengths? To what extent can we generalize this grid-like code to a simple association task? To what extent is the code related to conceptual knowledge?
- If this is about conceptual knowledge, then based on association, can people hold such representations when transitioning between outcomes? What's the use of the associative task in this experiment?
