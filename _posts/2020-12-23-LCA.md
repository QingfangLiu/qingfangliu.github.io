title: "Revisit LCA model"

Weirdly, the Leaky, Competing Accumulator (LCA) model is my most frequently used model during graduate school, but I have never fully explored this model over the years. I have noticed that LCA is typically considered as a model with neurobiological plausibility with its leakage and lateral inhibition mechanisms. It is also useful to be generalized to multiple-alternative decision making. In this blog, however, I focus on one particular question: when considering two-alternative decision task, what kind of choice and response time data can LCA account for, while the more popular DDM cannot? For this purpose, I first need to be able to simulate data using LCA.

- Bogacz 2006 argued that DDM is the optimal decision making strategy, while a few other accumulation models can be approximated as DDM under some conditions. 

- Tajima 2016 discussed the optimal decision strategy in the case of value-based decision making. 

- A recent model comparison of DDM and LCA by Bose, with an emphasis on equal evidence decision making problems.
