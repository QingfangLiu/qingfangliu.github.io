## Leaky Competing Accumulator model 

Weirdly, the Leaky, Competing Accumulator (LCA) model is my most familiar model during graduate school, but I have never fully explored this model over the years. In this blog, I focus on one question: what kind of choice and response time data can LCA account for, while the more popular DDM cannot? For this purpose, I first need to be able to simulate data using LCA.


This is my code

```
dt_tau = dt/tau
sqrt_dt_tau = sqrt(dt/tau)
lx = numeric(n.items)
crossed = 0

x=matrix(NA,max.time,n.items) # to store decision values
x[1,]=startx # start bias on each alternative
```
