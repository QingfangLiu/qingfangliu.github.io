title: "Revisit LCA model"

Weirdly, the Leaky, Competing Accumulator (LCA) model is my most frequently used model during graduate school, but I have never fully explored this model over the years. I have noticed that LCA is typically considered as a model with neurobiological plausibility with its leakage and lateral inhibition mechanisms. It is also useful to be generalized to multiple-alternative decision making. In this blog, however, I focus on one particular question: when considering two-alternative decision task, what kind of choice and response time data can LCA account for, while the more popular DDM cannot? For this purpose, I first need to be able to simulate data using LCA.
